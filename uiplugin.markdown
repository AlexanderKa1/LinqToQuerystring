## UI Plugin

Our UI plugin is the perfect client side partner to your queryable API, whether you are using Linq to Querystring, MS OData or another server offering. It allows you to easily construct complex OData compatible queries by selecting fields, operands or functions from drop down lists.

You can see it in action here: [http://linqtoquerystring.azurewebsites.net/](http://linqtoquerystring.azurewebsites.net/)

### Configuration



## NEW: Javascript Parser

With the introduction of the Linq to Querystring javascript parser, we can now not only generate queries from the UI, but also reverse the process and generate the UI based on a given query. This allows us to save filters constructed by users and then re-use them later on.
